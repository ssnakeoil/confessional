    "In recent years I thought I was quite content with life."

    "But as time goes by, I'm starting to realize…"

    "I want to be free."

    "Finally free. Truly free."

    "No matter how far I think I get from my problems, I always end up where I started."

    "I entered the cloister in order to help pay off my family's debt to the temple, but…"

    "In the end I can't help but feel unfulfilled."

    #"(Transition to room, light pours in.)"

    "My life at the temple has been monotonous, but I can't really complain."

    "I get a warm meal three times a day."

    "My job is boring, but easy enough."

    "Most of the day is spent praying. Part of it is charity work, studying or cleaning around the temple."

    "Nothing crazy, just quiet."

    "In my time off, I try to read or journal."

    "No reading material is barred from temple nuns despite what people are led to believe as temple outsiders…"

    "And… well…"

    "I'll never find nor marry the woman of my dreams while rotting away in the cloister…"

    "Nor will I be traveling particularly far to fight any dragons…"

    "But I can at least imagine myself in a world where I could for a couple moments every day."

    f "Sister Helena… It is your turn to receive confessions today."

    h "Ah… It slipped my mind, Mother Fatima… I will make my way-"

    f "See to it. A woman has been waiting in the booth since before you leisurely entered the sacristy."

    h "..."

    f "...I apologize for speaking over you, but I fear this is becoming regular."

    f "There's only so much I can do to keep you at the temple. The other mothers are starting to notice your… carefree attitude."

    h "It won't happen again, Mother Fatima."

    "She looked worried, but content with the contents of our brief meeting."

    f "Very well."

    ## Scene Change

    "I made my way to the confessional booth in a hurry."

    "The person behind the screen stirred as the sliding door behind me snuffed out what remained of the natural light."

    "I lit a candle and took my seat."

    h "Were you waiting long?"

    "I started calmly."

    hm "Not at all, ...{h}m-mother."

    "There was a hesitation in her voice, mixed with something I couldn't quite place."

    "I couldn't hold back a light giggle."

    hm "Ah-I'm.. I-I don't do this often. I'm sorry if I did something wrong..."

    "It seems the giggle may have sent her into a panic."

    h "I apologize. I should not have laughed."

    h "You have done nothing wrong. I am here to listen."
