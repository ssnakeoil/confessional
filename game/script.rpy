    "In recent years I thought I was quite content with life."

    "But as time goes by, I'm starting to realize…"

    "I want to be free."

    "Finally free. Truly free."

    "No matter how far I think I get from my problems, I always end up where I started."

    "I entered the cloister in order to help pay off my family's debt to the temple, but…"

    "In the end I can't help but feel unfulfilled."

    #"(Transition to room, light pours in.)"

    "My life at the temple has been monotonous, but I can't really complain."

    "I get a warm meal three times a day."

    "My job is boring, but easy enough."

    "Most of the day is spent praying. Part of it is charity work, studying or cleaning around the temple."

    "Nothing crazy, just quiet."

    "In my time off, I try to read or journal."

    "No reading material is barred from temple nuns despite what people are led to believe as temple outsiders…"

    "And… well…"

    "I'll never find nor marry the woman of my dreams while rotting away in the cloister…"

    "Nor will I be traveling particularly far to fight any dragons…"

    "But I can at least imagine myself in a world where I could for a couple moments every day."

    f "Sister Helen… It is your turn to receive confessions today."

    h "Ah… It slipped my mind, Mother Fatima… I will make my way-"

    f "See to it. A woman has been waiting in the booth since before you leisurely entered the sacristy."

    h "..."

    f "...I apologize for speaking over you, but I fear this is becoming regular."

    f "There's only so much I can do to keep you at the temple. The other mothers are starting to notice your… carefree attitude."

    h "It won't happen again, Mother Fatima."

    "She looked worried, but content with the contents of our brief meeting."

    f "Very well."

    ## Scene Change

    "I made my way to the confessional booth in a hurry."

    "The person behind the screen stirred as the sliding door behind me snuffed out what remained of the natural light."

    "I lit a candle and took my seat."

    h "Were you waiting long?"

    "I started calmly."

    hm "Not at all, ...{h}m-mother."

    "There was a hesitation in her voice,  with something I could only assume was... {h}confusion?"

    "I couldn't hold back a light giggle."

    hm "Ah-I'm.. I-I don't do this often. I'm sorry if I did something wrong..."

    "It seems the giggle may have sent her into a panic."

    h "I apologize. I should not have laughed."

    h "You have done nothing wrong. I am here to listen."

    h "...To more than just your confession, if you wish."

    hm "..."

    h "How about we start with names? I am Sister Helen."

    hm "...I'm Dame Cithara... My mom named me after Erato's lyre."

    h "Erato's lyre..."

    "I made a useless mental note of the origin of the name, knowing full well I would never meet this stranger again."

    h "A beautiful name."

    c "As is yours, Sister Helen."

    "My cheeks flushed as I tried to shake off the strange energy that had filled the booth."

    h "What brings you to the booth today, Cithara?"

    c "I'm afraid I'm here to confess my sins, Sister Helen."

    c "For the temple has been so hospitable to myself and the other knights and yet I covet the attention of a temple nun."

    "I halted in my seat, processing what she had just said."

    h "The attention of a temple nun?"

    h "{i}What could you possibly mean by that?{/i}"

    "Is what I wanted to say, but I needed to be careful with what I said next."

    c "I happened to see her in the library one passing night."

    c "At first, I was simply intrigued. But as I scanned the book in her hands, I realized it was one of my favorite anthologies."

    c "I did not dare approach her for my heart was set on her from that moment."

    "I could feel my own heart racing as I listened to her account of events."

    h "Was this anthology perchance a collection of poetry?"

    c "How did you know?"

    "My heart lept into my throat, but I fought with it to give some semblance of composure."

    h "Poetry is very popular among the nuns in the temple."

    "A lie. A bold-faced lie in the house of the holy pantheon. But my anonymity was at stake."

    "Was it true that she could simply ask for my name and find out it was me all along?"

    "Of course, but I could not let this leave this booth."

    "The sisters were no more interested in poetry than they were in the process of milling flour."

    "Hell, I only picked it up because one of the poems were mentioned in a smutty romance novel I was reading beforehand."

    "But a romantic scandal? The temple would go absolutely feral."

    c "I was told that the temple nuns could help me to sort through these thoughts through some form of counseling."

    "A moment of silence passed where I considered lying and refusing her, but my conscience prevailed."

    h "This is true, we at the temple are trained in many trades in order to better serve our community."

    c "Then you'll help me get rid of these feelings?"

    h "Well, Cithara... Fortunately, there is nothing in our teachings that says there is anything wrong with ...{h}becoming infatuated with a nun."

    h "Though temple nuns rarely leave the grounds, as our days are filled with prayer and charity work."

    h "I can help you to sort through your feelings, but I must ask that you do not act on them."

    h "Not only for her sake, but for yours as well."

    "My hand found it's way to my notepad, and I wrote down my office hours."

    "I temporarily lifted the screen, being sure to remain in the shadows as I handed her the paper."

    h "Please return at any of these times and we will continue your counseling."

    "She took the paper and paused to read it."

    c "Thank you, Sister Helen. I will come to your office as soon as I am done training."

    ## Scene Change (B4 Office Hours - Dormitory Hallway)

    "Why did I do that, why did I do that, why did I do that."

    "As soon as she opens the door to my office she'll see that it's me."

    "What then?"

    h "{i}I can explain.{/i}"

    "Then what! Tell her I, a temple nun, lied to her in the confessional?"

    "I can't do that."

## large text
    hm "Sister Helen." with vpunch

    h "S-s-sister Trinity!"

    h "What brings you to this wing?"

    t "You have a visitor for office hours..."

    "A woman emerged from behind her."

    "I gave a slight head nod instincttively while holding eye contact with the so-called visitor."

    "She went pale, as if having seen a ghost."

    hm "I-I apologize, I've just finished training and I'm a bit fatigued."

    h "Oh, is that so..."

    "Though she still had yet to formally introduce herself, the tone of her voice had already given her away to me."

    "In front of me was the knight from yesterday, Cithara."

    h "I'm very sorry to hear that."

    h "You came all this way to visit me, at least let me offer you some tea and a place to sit while you catch your breath."

    "The question was: how long would she keep this up?"

    c "Oh-ah no, I couldn't possibly... I should really... retire to my quarters..."

    "Her hesitation only made me more eager to capture her."

    "I've made up my mind: I need to see where this goes."

    ###CHOICE
    "But should I be patient and wait until she tells me who she is or reveal that I know it's her?"
